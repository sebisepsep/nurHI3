Each dataset contains the number and position of satellite galaxies and the number of halos.\\
Step 1:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item number of radial bins: 75
    \item space: real
    \item range: per iteration max(r)
\end{itemize}
I have chosen 75 bins for every plot because I observed the number of galaxies for each dataset and wanted even the smallest one to have a representative number of bins. The maximum value changes for each dataset to avoid many empty bins. Additionally, since there was an opportunity to use real spacing, I utilized it because I personally find it more intuitive. On the other hand, I haven't seen the advantage of logarithmic spacing.
Step 2: \\
Calculate the mean number of galaxies per halo per dataset:
\begin{align}
    \langle N_{sat} \rangle = \frac{\# Galaxies}{\# Halos}
\end{align}
Bin the satellite galaxy radii to get a mean number of satellites:
\begin{align}
    N[i] &= \# Galaxies \in [x_i,x_{i+1}]\\
    N &= \frac{N}{\# Halos}
\end{align}
These are our datapoints. \\
Now we want to minimize a $\chi^2$:
\begin{align}
    \chi^2 &= \sum_i \frac{\q{N_i-\text{Model}_i(a,b,c)}^2}{\sigma_i^2}\\
    \chi^2 &= \sum_i \frac{\q{N_i-\Tilde{N}_i(a,b,c)}^2}{\Tilde{N}_i(a,b,c)_i^2}
\end{align}
Where:
\begin{align}
    \Tilde{N}_i(a,b,c) &= 4 \pi \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}}n(x,a,b,c)x^2dx \\
    &= 4 \pi A(a,b,c)\cdot \langle N_{sat} \rangle \f{1}{b}^{a-3}  \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}}x^{a-1} \exp\q{-\f{x}{b}^{c}} dx
\end{align}
With:
\begin{align}
    n(a,b,c,x) &= A(a,b,c)\cdot \langle N_{sat} \rangle \f{x}{b}^{a-3} \exp\q{-\f{x}{b}^{c}}\\
    A(a,b,c) &= \q{4\pi \f{1}{b}^{a-3} \int_0^{x_{max}} x^{a-1} \exp\q{-\f{x}{b}^c} dx}^{-1}
\end{align}

In the figures, we can see the best-fit data of the chi-squared fit and the binned data. For this task, we used a combination of the conjugate gradient method and the golden ratio search. It is obvious that neither of the fits adequately captures the data. Additionally, from the golden ratio search, we noticed that we were not significantly altering the initial parameters in this configuration. In the worst-case scenario, we ended up with values that did not change in the golden ratio search. To prevent this, we added a step that tightens the bracket to potentially move closer to the minimum of the linear minimization. Unfortunately, the values did not change, so this fit remains a valid approximation of the data. Whenever the title of a figure indicates "error in golden ratio," it means that the method became stuck, and thus the result returned was the same as before, with our check value being zero. The best-fit data is therefore entirely dominated by the initial values. I also experimented with many initial parameters, which could potentially align the plots better, but this alignment was solely due to the initial settings. On the other hand, I have applied this algorithm to many functions depending on three values and successfully minimized it each time. Hence, there might be another mistake in the chi-squared formula. I acknowledge that the plots should be logarithmic-logarithmic, but since I have opted for real spacing, changing it would disrupt the entire diagram. Additionally, the entire algorithm was quite sensitive to changes in accuracies and initial brackets for the line minimization.
